# Low-Rank-Repair
An implementation of the paper called "Repairing Low Rank Texture"

# Special issues
This version has correctlly implemented the alogrithm, but still need some tweaks. For example, the panelty term `t` in the program will 
heavily influence the output.  
In addition, the algorithm can be accelerated to O(rn^2) (current is O(n^3))
